# Gilded Rose Refactoring Kata

# This version is the refactored Kata from gilded rose by the author of this git. Feel free to take contact with me by email if you have any remark.

ADDED NOTE. This is the default description for this kata. I kept it for reference and credit to the original autor, removed unecessary part.

__________________________________________________________________

This Kata was originally created by Terry Hughes (http://twitter.com/TerryHughes). It is already on GitHub [here](https://github.com/NotMyself/GildedRose). See also [Bobby Johnson's description of the kata](https://iamnotmyself.com/refactor-this-the-gilded-rose-kata/).

I translated the original C# into a few other languages, (with a little help from my friends!), and slightly changed the starting position. This means I've actually done a small amount of refactoring already compared with the original form of the kata, and made it easier to get going with writing tests by giving you one failing unit test to start with. I also added test fixtures for Text-Based approval testing with TextTest (see [the TextTests](https://github.com/emilybache/GildedRose-Refactoring-Kata/tree/master/texttests))

As Bobby Johnson points out in his article ["Why Most Solutions to Gilded Rose Miss The Bigger Picture"](https://iamnotmyself.com/why-most-solutions-to-gilded-rose-miss-the-bigger-picture/), it'll actually give you
better practice at handling a legacy code situation if you do this Kata in the original C#. However, I think this kata
is also really useful for practicing writing good tests using different frameworks and approaches, and the small changes I've made help with that. I think it's also interesting to compare what the refactored code and tests look like in different programming languages.

I use this kata as part of my work as a technical coach. I wrote a lot about the coaching method I use in this book [Technical Agile Coaching with the Samman method](https://leanpub.com/techagilecoach). A while back I wrote this article ["Writing Good Tests for the Gilded Rose Kata"](http://coding-is-like-cooking.info/2013/03/writing-good-tests-for-the-gilded-rose-kata/) about how you could use this kata in a [coding dojo](https://leanpub.com/codingdojohandbook).

## Text-Based Approval Testing

Most language versions of this code have a [TextTest](https://texttest.org) fixture for Approval testing. For information about this, see the [TextTests README](https://github.com/emilybache/GildedRose-Refactoring-Kata/tree/master/texttests)
